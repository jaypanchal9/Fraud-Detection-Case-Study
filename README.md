# Fraud Detection Case Study

## Overview

This project focuses on building a robust model for detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The implementation leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and various predictive modeling techniques to identify and mitigate financial fraud.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of fraudulent transactions.
- Apply data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Engineer meaningful features to improve predictive performance.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to detect fraud effectively.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains historical transaction data labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. Key attributes include transaction amount, time, user details, and transaction type.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration

- Understanding data distribution.
- Identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values.
- Dealing with class imbalance using techniques such as undersampling or oversampling.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Creating derived features that enhance the ability to detect fraud.
- Scaling and normalizing data for improved model performance.

### 4. Modeling

- Implementing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### 5. Model Selection and Evaluation

- Comparing performance across different models.
- Selecting the best-performing model based on metrics suited for imbalanced datasets.
